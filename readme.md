## Overview

ðŸ”´ This is a frontend alarm clock project.
ðŸ”´ It has very similar features like an Alarm Clock.
ðŸ”´ You can set alarm at any desired time, the alarm ringtone will play at that time.
ðŸ”´ The most important thing about this project is it makes use of local storage of your browser to store the alarm timings, that means if you accidentally close the tab or entire window, the alarm you set is not gone. When you revisit the page you find teh timings set by you.
ðŸ”´ It also has features to stop the alarm and also to snooze.
